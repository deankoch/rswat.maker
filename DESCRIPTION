Description: This prepares the datasets required for running QSWAT+ on a basin of interest in the USA.
The package includes tools for fetching an NHDPlus model for the basin, a DEM, land use and soils
raster, USGS stream gage data, and more. Given an outlet location, users can call package functions
to step through the entire process of building a (untrained) SWAT+ model, ready for execution in the
simulator.
