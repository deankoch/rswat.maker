# rswat.maker

An R package for building QSWAT+ inputs and creating SWAT+ projects

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->


## Installation

You can install the development version of rswat.maker like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github('deankoch/rswat.maker')
```

## Background

A number of different earth sciences datasets are needed to initialize a SWAT+ model:

* landscape feature polygons - including an AOI and the water bodies in it
* digital elevation model raster (DEM)
* land use raster (and lookup table)
* soils classification raster (and lookup table)
* stream flow time series

rswat.maker takes an outlet location of interest, finds the corresponding
watershed area, then downloads and processes the required datasets from public sources.
It produces a set of output files ready for QSWAT+, and retains copies of the source
datasets for later use. Then it uses `shell` to run QSWAT+, followed by SWAT+ Editor.
The result is a SWAT+ model directory that is ready for training.

rswat.maker is primarily a data-retrieval package, so it can also be useful to
hydrologists and earth systems modelers who aren't interested in the SWAT+ simulator.
rswat.maker is connected to rswat in that it serves as a source of example data, and we 
use both tools together in our project. However, with the exception of `write_wx`,
rswat.maker does not depend on rswat. In fact, users can run most of the workflow in
rswat.maker (all but the last three steps) without touching SWAT+ or its helper software.


## History

rswat.maker is largely based on code in the URYW_data repository, now much simplified
so that it can be maintained as a self-contained R package. 

Our watershed of interest is the Upper Yellowstone, so most of the testing in rswat.maker
has focused on areas upstream of Carter's Bridge, Montana (near Livingston). This includes
Paradise Valley and most of Yellowstone National Park. In the vignette we look at one its
tributaries, the Lamar River.


## Motivation

The purpose of rswat.maker is to automate and document ETL for the datasets required by
QSWAT+ when creating any new SWAT+ model. This is part of a larger effort to create
reproducible workflows for SWAT+ simulations in research

The package helps us manage a freshwater forecasting system for the Upper Yellowstone
River (UYR) watershed based around SWAT+ simulations.


## Development to-do list

* CRAN checks
* Lamar River vignette
