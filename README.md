# rswat.uyr

An R package for building QSWAT+ inputs

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

## Installation

You can install the development version of rswat.uyr like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github('deankoch/rswat.uyr')
```

## Workflow

A number of different earth sciences datasets are needed to initialize a
SWAT+ model:

- landscape feature polygons - including AOI and water bodies
- digital elevation model raster (DEM)
- land use raster (and lookup table)
- soils classification raster (and lookup table)

rswat_uyr takes an outlet location of interest, finds the corresponding
watershed area, then downloads and processes the required datasets. It
produces a set of output files ready for QSWAT+, and retains copies of
the source datasets for later use.

## History

rswat_uyr is largely based on code in the URYW_data repository, now much
simplified so that it can be maintained as a self-contained R package.

Our watershed of interest is the Upper Yellowstone, so testing and
examples in rswat.uyr focus on areas upstream of Carterâ€™s Bridge,
Montana. This includes Paradise Valley and most of Yellowstone National
Park.

rswat.uyr is connected to rswat in that it serves as a source of example
data. However rswat is not required. The rswat.uyr workflow prepares
inputs to QSWAT+, whereas rswat manages the SWAT+ model config files
that are created by QSWAT+.

## Motivation

The purpose of rswat.uyr is to automate and document ETL for the
datasets required by QSWAT+ when creating any new SWAT+ model. This is
part of a larger effort to create reproducible workflows for SWAT+
simulations in research

The package helps us manage a freshwater forecasting system for the
Upper Yellowstone River (UYR) watershed based around SWAT+ simulations.

## Devlopment To-Do List

- make a common helpers file
- make sure all geojson files use WGS84 coordinates
- project to appropriate UTM zone before doing s2 operations
- finish watershed splitter
- Blacktail Deer example
