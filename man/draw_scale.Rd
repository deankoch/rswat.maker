\arguments{
\item{obj}{the sf object that was used to create the plot}

\item{bottom}{logical, whether to position the scale bar at top or bottom}

\item{left}{logical, whether to position the scale bar at left or right}

\item{above}{logical, whether to position the text above or below the line}

\item{draw}{logical, whether to draw the scale bar or just return it as data frame}

\item{size}{numeric > 0 controls the width of the scale bar (see details)}

\item{y_adj}{numeric, up/down position adjustment factor for text}

\item{outer_adj, }{outer/inner position adjustment factor for scale bar}

\item{lwd}{numeric line width, passed to \code{sf::plot.sf}}

\item{cex}{numeric text size expansion factor, passed to \code{text}}

\item{col}{passed to both \code{sf::plot.sf} and \code{text} for drawing}

\item{box_col}{character or NA, a color for painting the box behind the scale bar}
}
\value{
sf LINESTRING data frame describing and positioning the scale bar
}
\description{
This returns a LINESTRING geometry representing a scale bar, and optionally draws
it on the plot along with a label giving the distance and units.
}
\details{
The function returns a LINESTRING geometry of known length located in one of the four
corners of the bounding box for \code{obj} (depending on the choice of \code{bottom} and \code{left}).
The length is selected by finding a \code{pretty} number close (but less than or equal) to
\code{size} times the horizontal span of the bounding box, and the units are always in 'km'
(or 'm' if the distance is less than 1 km).

Move the text label up and down with respect to the scale bar line using \code{y_adj},
expressed in units of character height. Move the whole scale bar inwards or outwards
using \code{outer_adj}, expressed as a proportion of the square root of the area of the
bounding box. \code{cex}, \code{col}, \code{lwd} have their usual meanings (see \code{?plot}) and \code{col}
is applied to box the line and text. \code{box_col} causes the function to first draw a
rectangle of the requested color behind the scale bar (\code{box_border} is also passed to
\code{rect} to set the border color).

Results are always returned in the coordinate system of the input \code{obj}, but if \code{obj}
is in geographical coordinates (lon/lat) then computations are done in the UTM projection.
This means scale bars in lon/lat plots may look curved, but the reported distance will
be accurate for the path length of the line.
