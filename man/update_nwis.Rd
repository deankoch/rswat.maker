\title{Update NWIS data files on disk by downloading latest dates}
\usage{
update_nwis(
  data_dir,
  from = NULL,
  param_code = "00060",
  stat_code = "00003",
  n_sec = 0.5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_dir}{character path to the directory to use for output files}

\item{from}{Date (or any other object coercible Date) from which to start update}

\item{param_code, }{the parameter code to update}

\item{stat_code, }{the statistic code to update}

\item{n_sec}{numeric >= 0, the number of seconds to wait between requests}
}
\value{
returns nothing but possibly writes to CSV files in "raw" subdirectory
}
\description{
This loops over the site codes listed in the file \code{save_nwis(data_dir)['station']},
calling \code{data_nwis} to download all new records starting from the date \code{from}, and
storing the results on disk in CSV files in the "raw" sub-directory.
}
\details{
If \code{from} is NULL and there is no existing file on disk, the function downloads all
available dates and creates the file. If there is a file on disk already and \code{from}
is NULL, the function sets \code{from} to the day after the latest date in the file.

The function will overwrite existing files without warning, but existing values in
the file on dates prior to \code{from} are not modified. New dates are added to the file
and existing dates with new values are overwritten.

Specify the variable and statistic of interest with \code{param_code} and \code{stat_code}
(see \code{?list_nwis}). \code{n_sec} should be left alone unless you know what you are doing
and plan to respect the Water Service API rate limits (see also \code{?data_nwis}).
